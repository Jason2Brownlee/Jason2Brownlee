# Hello and Welcome!

I love writing code and writing words to help people solve problems.

I trained and worked as a software engineer for a long time, but I'm known online for my work on **Computational Intelligence** (e.g. [Clever Algorithms](https://cleveralgorithms.com)), **Machine Learning** (e.g. [Machine Learning Mastery](https://MachineLearningMastery.com), sold in 2021) and **Python Concurrency** ([Super Fast Python](https://SuperFastPython.com)).

Most of my public repositories will be related to machine learning or to my hobby as a Quake archivist.

You can learn more about me and my projects on my [personal homepage](https://jasonbrownlee.me/).
