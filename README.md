# Hello and Welcome!

I love writing code and writing words to help people solve problems.

I'm known for my work on machine learning (e.g. [Machine Learning Mastery](https://MachineLearningMastery.com), sold in 2021) and python concurrency ([Super Fast Python](https://SuperFastPython.com)).

Most of my public repositories will be related to machine learning or to my hobby as a Quake archivist.

You can learn more about me and my projects on my [personal homepage](https://jasonbrownlee.me/).
