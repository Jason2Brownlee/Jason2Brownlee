# Hello and Welcome!

I'm a research scientist and software engineer and spend my time writing words and code.

My known for my work on predictive modeling/machine learning (e.g. [MachineLearningMastery](https://MachineLearningMastery.com) which I sold in 2021) and python concurrency ([SuperFastPython](https://SuperFastPython.com)).

You can learn more about me and my projects on my [personal homepage](https://jasonbrownlee.me/).
