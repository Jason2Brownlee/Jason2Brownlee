# Hello and Welcome!

My name is Jason Brownlee, PhD.

I trained and worked as a **Software Engineer** for many years (e.g. enterprise, R&D, and scientific computing), but I'm known online for my work on **Computational Intelligence** (e.g. [Clever Algorithms](https://cleveralgorithms.com)), **Machine Learning** (e.g. [Machine Learning Mastery](https://MachineLearningMastery.com), sold in 2021) and **Python Concurrency** ([Super Fast Python](https://SuperFastPython.com)).

Most of my public repositories are related to **Machine Learning** or to my hobby as a **Quake Archivist**.

You can learn more about me and my projects on my [personal homepage](https://jasonbrownlee.me/).
